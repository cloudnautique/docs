## Creating Custom Catalogs

Creating a custom catalog for Rancher is very straight forward. The catalogs are hosted in Git repositories and cloned into Rancher on a periodic basis.

The charts themselves are standard [Helm templates](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/chart_template_guide/getting_started.md), with a few differences outlined below.

### Rancher Chart Structure

A Rancher chart repository differs slightly in directory structure from upstream repos in that it includes an `app version` directory. Though Rancher can use native Helm repositories as well.

A Rancher chart also has two additional files an `app-readme.md` file that provides a high level overview display in the Rancher 2.x UI and a `questions.yml` file defining questions to prompt the user with. 

```

charts/wordpress/<app version>/
  app-readme.md            # Rancher Specific: Readme file for display in Rancher 2.0 UI
  charts/                  # Directory containing dependency charts
  Chart.yaml               # Required Helm chart information file
  questions.yml            # Rancher Specific: File containing questions for Rancher 2. UI
  README.md                # Optional: Helm Readme file (will be rendered in Rancher 2.0 UI as well)
  requirements.yaml        # Optional YAML file listing dependencies for the chart
  templates/               # A directory of templates that, when combined with values.yml will generate K8s YAML
  values.yaml              # The default configuration values for this chart
```

*See the upstream Helm chart [developer reference](https://docs.helm.sh/developing_charts/) for a complete walk through of developing charts.*

To convert an upstream chart to take advantage of Rancher's enhanced UX, first create an `app-readme.md` file in the root of your chart.

```
$ cat ./app-readme.md

# Wordpress ROCKS!
```

Then add a `questions.yml` file to prompt the user for something.

```
categories:
- Blog
- CMS
questions:
- variable: persistence.enabled
  default: "false"
  description: "Enable persistent volume for WordPress"
  type: boolean
  required: true
  label: WordPress Persistent Volume Enabled
  show_subquestion_if: true
  group: "WordPress Settings"
  subquestions:
  - variable: persistence.size
    default: "10Gi"
    description: "WordPress Persistent Volume Size"
    type: string
    label: WordPress Volume Size
  - variable: persistence.storageClass
    default: ""
    description: "If undefined or null, uses the default StorageClass. Default to null"
    type: storageclass
    label: Default StorageClass for WordPress
```

The above will prompt the user with a true / false radio button in the UI for enabling persistent storage. If the user choses to enable persistent storage they will be prompted for a storage class and volume size.

The above file also provides a list of categories that this chart fits into. This helps users navigate and filtering when browsing the catalog UI.

#### Question Variable Reference

| Variable  | Type | Required | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | --- |------------- |
| 	variable          | string  | true    |  define the variable name specified in the `values.yaml`file, using `foo.bar` for nested object. |
| 	label             | string  | true      |  define the UI label. |
| 	description       | string  | false      |  specify the description of the variable.|
| 	type              | string  | false      |  default to `string` if not specified (current supported types are string, boolean, int, enum, password, storageclass and hostname).|
| 	required          | bool    | false      |  define if the variable is required or not (true \| false)|
| 	default           | string  | false      |  specify the default value. |
| 	group             | string  | false      |  group questions by input value. |
| 	min_length        | int     | false      | min character length.|
| 	max_length        | int     | false      | max character length.|
| 	min               | int     | false      |  min integer length. |
| 	max               | int     | false      |  max integer length. |
| 	options           | []string | false     |  specify the options when the vriable type is `enum`, for example: options:<br> - "ClusterIP" <br> - "NodePort" <br> - "LoadBalancer"|
| 	valid_chars       | string   | false     |  regular expression for input chars validation. |
| 	invalid_chars     | string   | false     |  regular expression for invalid input chars validation.|
| 	subquestions      | []subquestion | false|  add an array of subquestions.|
| 	show_if           | string      | false  | show current variable if conditional variable is true, for example `show_if: "serviceType=Nodeport"` |
| 	show\_subquestion_if |  string  | false     | show subquestions if is true or equal to one of the options. for example `show_subquestion_if: "true"`|

**subquestions**: `subquestions[]` cannot contain `subquestions` or `show_subquestions_if` keys, but all other keys in the above table are supported. 

## Adding Catalog of Helm Charts to Rancher

Currently, catalogs can only be ad added to Rancher at a global level, which means any catalog added will be shared with all clusters and projects. 

At the global level in Rancher UI

* Select `Catalogs` from the top level nav.
* Click `Add Catalog` button in upper left hand corner of UI.
* Give the catalog a name. This will be visible across all projects.
* Provide the Git URL of the catalog repository.
* Provide the Git branch you would like to use.
* Click `Create`

In a few moments, the new catalog will refresh and be availble to launch applications from in projects.

> **Note:** Currently, only unauthenticated catalogs are supported in Rancher.
